# Next Steps for BRX Platform Database Setup

## What We've Accomplished

1. ✅ Created the database architecture using Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Upstash (Redis)
2. ✅ Set up the Prisma schema for Exercise.com data
3. ✅ Created utility classes for database and cache operations
4. ✅ Updated the dashboard router to use real data
5. ✅ Created a seed script for initial data
6. ✅ Set up the environment configuration

## What You Need to Do Next

1. **Update Your Environment Variables**:
   - Edit `../v0-recreate-visual-design/.env.local` with your actual Supabase and Upstash credentials
   - Get your Supabase credentials from your Supabase project dashboard
   - Get your Upstash credentials from your Upstash Redis dashboard

2. **Push the Schema to Your Database**:
   ```bash
   cd ../v0-recreate-visual-design
   npx prisma db push
   ```

3. **Seed the Database**:
   ```bash
   cd ../v0-recreate-visual-design
   npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   cd ../v0-recreate-visual-design
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Verify the Integration**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   - Check that the stats are loading from the database
   - Check the browser console for any connection errors
