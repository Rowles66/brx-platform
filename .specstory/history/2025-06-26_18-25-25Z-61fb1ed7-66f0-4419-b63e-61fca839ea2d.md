MCP is an open protocol that enables language models to access external tools and data sources. Key configuration aspects include:

Server Types:
- Stdio servers
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) servers
- HTTP servers

Configuration Methods:
1. Add servers using CLI commands
2. Configure with JSON
3. Import from Claude Desktop
4. Use Claude Code as an MCP server

Scope Levels:
- Local: Project-specific, private configuration
- Project: Shared team configuration
- User: Cross-project accessibility

Key Features:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication support
- Resource referencing via @ mentions
- Slash commands for server-exposed prompts

Important Security Note: "Use third party MCP servers at your own risk. Make sure you trust the MCP servers."

Example Server Addition:
```bash
claude mcp add postgres-server /path/to/postgres-mcp-server --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

Recommended Use: Carefully evaluate and trust MCP servers before integration.

Based on the document, here are key points about MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

MCP servers enable LLMs to access external tools and data sources. They can be configured in three scopes:

1. Local Scope: Personal servers specific to one project
2. Project Scope: Shared servers for team collaboration
3. User Scope: Servers accessible across multiple projects

Server types include:
- Stdio servers
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) servers
- HTTP servers

Configuration commands:
- Add a server: `claude mcp add <name> <command>`
- List servers: `claude mcp list`
- Get server details: `claude mcp get <server-name>`

Key features:
- Support OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Can reference resources using `@` mentions
- Expose prompts as slash commands
- Provide tools like database querying, file access, and more

The document warns: "Use third party MCP servers at your own risk" due to potential prompt injection risks.

    82→```
    83→
    84→### Important Notes about MCP Servers
    85→
    86→MCP servers communicate via stdio (standard input/output), not HTTP. This means:
    87→
    88→1. **You cannot directly connect to the Docker container via HTTP**
    89→2. **The server needs to be connected through Claude Desktop app**
    90→3. **Docker is useful for consistent environments but requires special configuration**
    91→
    92→### Connecting Docker MCP Server to Claude
    93→
    94→Since MCP servers use stdio, connecting a Dockerized MCP server to Claude Desktop requires a bridge. Here are the options:
    95→
    96→1. **Run locally instead** (Recommended): The simplest approach
    97→   ```bash
    98→   npm install
    99→   npm start
   100→   ```
   101→
   102→2. **Use Docker with a stdio bridge**: Create a local script that bridges Docker stdio
   103→   ```bash
   104→   #!/bin/bash
   105→   docker run -i --rm -v $(pwd)/../:/workspace:ro brx-mcp-server
   106→   ```
   107→
   108→3. **Use the native setup**: Configure in Claude Desktop's settings with the local path
   109→
   110→## Testing
   111→
   112→You can test the MCP server by running it and sending JSON-RPC requests via stdio:
   113→
   114→```bash
   115→# Test the server directly
   116→echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "id": 1}' | node src/index.js
   117→```
   118→
   119→Or by connecting it through Claude Code with the provided configuration.

## MCP Server Configuration Examples and Popular Servers

Based on my search through your codebase and online resources, here's a comprehensive overview of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers commonly used with Claude Code:

### Your Current MCP Configuration

In your BRX platform project, you have:

1. **Custom BRX Platform MCP Server** (`/Users/joshrowles/projects/brx-platform/mcp-server/`)
   - Built with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v0.5.0
   - Provides project-specific tools: `get_project_info`, `analyze_codebase`, `get_development_context`
   - Can run via Docker or locally with Node.js

2. **Claude Desktop Configuration** (`/Users/joshrowles/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`)
   - Uses Docker MCP gateway for managing multiple servers
   - Configured with: `/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker`

### Popular MCP Servers

#### Official Reference Servers
1. **Filesystem** - Secure file operations with configurable access controls
   ```json
   {
     "filesystem": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Memory** - Knowledge graph-based persistent memory system
   ```json
   {
     "memory": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **GitHub** - Repository management and GitHub API integration
   ```json
   {
     "github": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
       "env": {
         "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

#### Database Servers
- **PostgreSQL** - Direct PostgreSQL database access
- **SQLite** - Local SQLite database operations
- **MySQL** - MySQL database connectivity
- **DuckDB** - Analytics database integration
- **Supabase** - Real-time PostgreSQL with built-in auth

#### Development Tools
- **Git** - Local Git repository operations
- **Docker** - Container and compose stack management
- **VSCode** - IDE integration for semantic code analysis
- **npm/yarn** - Package management operations

#### Web & API Services
- **Fetch** - Web content fetching optimized for LLMs
- **Puppeteer** - Browser automation and web scraping
- **Slack** - Workspace integration without admin approval
- **Gmail** - Email access with auto-authentication
- **Stripe** - Payment API integration

#### AI/ML Services
- **HuggingFace Spaces** - Access to HF models and datasets
- **LlamaCloud** - Managed index connectivity
- **OpenAI** - API integration (requires key)

### Common Configuration Patterns

1. **Local NPX-based servers** (most common):
   ```json
   {
     "server-name": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-name", "...config"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Docker-based servers**:
   ```json
   {
     "server-name": {
       "command": "docker",
       "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp-server-image"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Local Node.js servers**:
   ```json
   {
     "server-name": {
       "command": "node",
       "args": ["/path/to/server/index.js"],
       "env": {
         "NODE_ENV": "development"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Security Considerations
- Filesystem access should be restricted to specific directories
- API keys should be managed through environment variables or secure stores
- Third-party servers should be reviewed for security before use
- Docker provides isolation but requires proper configuration

The MCP ecosystem is rapidly growing with community contributions adding new servers for various services and integrations. The protocol uses stdio (standard input/output) for communication, which is why servers need specific configuration to work with Claude Desktop.

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I've successfully configured 4 MCP servers for your project:

1. **PostgreSQL Server** - Direct database access to your Supabase instance
2. **Filesystem Server** - Enhanced file operations within your project directory
3. **Memory Server** - Persistent context storage across sessions
4. **GitHub Server** - Repository management (requires GitHub token via environment variable)

To use the GitHub server with authentication, you'll need to set:
```bash
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

You can now use these servers in Claude Code by referencing them with `@` mentions. For example:
- `@postgres` for database queries
- `@filesystem` for file operations
- `@memory` to store/retrieve context
- `@github` for repository operations
