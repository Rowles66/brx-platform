# BRX Performance Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document consolidates all implementation steps and completion summaries for the BRX Performance reverse engineering project.

## Completed Implementation Steps

### Step 3: Project Architecture & Planning
- ✅ Defined project structure and dependencies
- ✅ Established development workflow
- ✅ Created documentation framework

### Step 4: UI Component Extraction
- ✅ Scraped BRX Performance authentication pages
- ✅ Converted HTML to React components using AI tools
- ✅ Created reusable UI components in `src/components/scraped/`
- ✅ Implemented Storybook stories for component documentation
- ✅ Extracted authentic BRX styling and branding

### Step 5: Next.js 14 + tRPC Project Setup
- ✅ Created Next.js 14 project with App Router
- ✅ Configured TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Set up ESLint for code quality
- ✅ Enabled Turbopack for faster development
- ✅ Implemented tRPC for type-safe APIs
- ✅ Created comprehensive router structure

### Step 6: Database Schema Definition
- ✅ Created automated schema generation script
- ✅ Analyzed scraped UI forms for data models
- ✅ Defined comprehensive Prisma schema
- ✅ Established User, Exercise, Workout, and relationship models
- ✅ Integrated form validation with database schema

### Step 7: tRPC Router Implementation
- ✅ Implemented auth router with authentication logic
- ✅ Created exercises router for exercise management
- ✅ Built workouts router for workout functionality
- ✅ Developed user-progress router for tracking
- ✅ Added comprehensive input/output validation with Zod

### Step 9: Firecrawl Automation & Testing
- ✅ Implemented automated scraping with Firecrawl
- ✅ Created comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright
- ✅ Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Integrated 1Password for secure secrets management
- ✅ Developed robust testing framework with 170+ tests

## Current Status: 60-70% Complete

### What's Working
- Complete UI structure with authentic BRX design
- Type-safe API architecture with tRPC
- Comprehensive component library
- Advanced form validation system
- Excellent testing framework

### What Needs Implementation
- Database connection (schema exists but not connected)
- Real authentication system (currently mocked)
- Exercise.com API integration (currently static data)
- Production deployment configuration

## Next Steps
1. Connect Prisma to PostgreSQL database
2. Implement real authentication with NextAuth
3. Replace mock data with Exercise.com API calls
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Performance optimization for production
