- Quality assurance checklist

## Key Findings

### Evidence-Based Weighting Applied

| Evidence Type | Weight Multiplier | Confidence Boost |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| API + UI + Runtime | 1.5x | +50% confidence |
| API + UI | 1.3x | +30% confidence |
| API Only | 0.8x | -20% confidence |
| UI Only | 0.8x | -20% confidence |
| Runtime Only | 1.0x | Baseline |

### Top Priority Features (RICE > 100)

1. **Authentication** (RICE: 405) - API + UI evidence, foundational
2. **User Management** (RICE: 149) - API + UI + Runtime evidence
3. **Workout Management** (RICE: 146) - API + UI evidence, core value
4. **Exercise Management** (RICE: 112) - API + UI evidence

### Critical Gaps Identified

#### ðŸ”´ High-Risk API-Only Features
- **Legacy v3 endpoints**: 9 endpoints with no UI evidence
- **User Plans Management**: 7 endpoints, potentially missing MVP feature
- **Action Required**: Immediate investigation with development team

#### ðŸŸ¢ Positive Validation
- **No UI-Only features found**: All scraped UI has corresponding APIs
- **Strong correlation**: 88 mappings across 15 categories
- **High confidence in implementability**

## MVP Phase Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core MVP (Weeks 1-4)
**Features with RICE > 100 and full evidence validation**
- Authentication System (foundational requirement)
- User Management (core user operations)
- Basic Workout Management (primary app value)

### Phase 2: Extended MVP (Weeks 5-8)
**Features with RICE 70-100 and strong evidence**
- Exercise Management
- Business/Appointment Management (simplified)
- Calendar Integration

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
**Features with RICE 40-70**
- Communication features
- Equipment management
- Group/team functionality

## Risk Mitigation

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Audit legacy v3 endpoints** - determine deprecation status
2. **Investigate user plans feature** - check if admin-only or missing UI
3. **Plan API version migration strategy** - standardize on v4

### Implementation Guidelines
- Start with highest weighted RICE scores
- Prioritize features with both API and UI evidence
- Investigate API-only features before implementation
- Break complex features (40+ endpoints) into smaller components

## Integration with Cursor/Claude

### Ready-to-Use AI Prompt
The `ai_prioritization_prompt_template.md` can be directly imported into AI tools to ensure:
- Evidence-based decision making
- Consistent RICE scoring methodology
- Gap-aware recommendations
- Real data grounding vs assumptions

### Sample AI Query Results
**Query**: "What should be our MVP priority?"
**AI Response** (using new prompt): 
- Authentication System (RICE: 405) - 3 API endpoints + UI + foundational
- User Management (RICE: 149) - 5 API endpoints + UI + 2 runtime calls
- Core Workout CRUD (RICE: 146) - 25+ endpoints, note v3/v4 mixed APIs

## Data Quality Assessment

### Evidence Strength
- **136 API endpoints analyzed** from Swagger documentation
- **88 UI-to-API mappings** generated from scraping
- **17 runtime network requests** captured
- **15 feature categories** identified and scored

### Validation Metrics
- **100% UI features have API support** (positive validation)
- **~12% API endpoints lack UI evidence** (flagged for investigation)
- **Strong correlation** between documented and implemented features

## Next Steps Recommendations

### For Development Team
1. **Review gap analysis findings** with backend developers
2. **Validate user plans feature scope** - MVP inclusion decision
3. **Plan v3 to v4 API migration** timeline
4. **Break down Business Management** into smaller MVP components

### For Product Team
1. **Use weighted RICE scores** for sprint planning
2. **Start with Phase 1 features** (Authentication, User Management, Core Workouts)
3. **Investigate high-value API-only features** before next planning cycle
4. **Apply evidence-based weighting** to future feature decisions

### For AI-Assisted Development
1. **Import prompt template** into Cursor/Claude
2. **Reference weighted scores** for feature decisions
3. **Update evidence** as development progresses
4. **Maintain gap analysis** with new findings
