# Step 9: FireCrawl Automation Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of automated nightly FireCrawl snapshots for content extraction.

## Overview

Implemented a complete automation system for FireCrawl content extraction that:
1. Runs nightly extractions using the FireCrawl API
2. Creates date-specific branches for version control
3. Pushes results with proper git workflows
4. Integrates with GitHub Actions for automation
5. Provides Slack notifications for success/failure alerts
6. Includes comprehensive caching and error handling

## Files Created

### Core Scripts

1. **`scripts/extract_with_firecrawl.py`**
   - Python script for FireCrawl API integration
   - Configurable extraction targets
   - Error handling and structured output
   - 1Password integration for secure API key access

2. **`scripts/run-nightly-firecrawl.sh`**
   - Main orchestration script
   - Git branch management for dated snapshots
   - Comprehensive error handling and cleanup
   - Command-line options for manual testing

3. **`scripts/test-firecrawl-setup.sh`**
   - Setup validation script
   - Checks all dependencies and configuration
   - Provides setup guidance and troubleshooting

4. **`scripts/requirements.txt`**
   - Python dependencies for FireCrawl scripts

### GitHub Actions Workflow

5. **`.github/workflows/nightly-firecrawl.yml`**
   - Complete automation workflow
   - Scheduled nightly runs (2:00 AM UTC)
   - Manual trigger support with custom parameters
   - Python dependency caching
   - Pull request creation for extracted content
   - Slack notifications with detailed status
   - Artifact uploads for extraction results
   - Cleanup on failures

### Documentation

6. **`.github/workflows/README.md`**
   - Workflow documentation and setup instructions

7. **`frontend_sources/README.md`**
   - Documentation for extraction output structure

8. **Updated `scripts/README.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation for all scripts

## Key Features

### Security
- ✅ 1Password CLI integration for secure credential management
- ✅ Service account tokens for GitHub Actions
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code

### Automation
- ✅ Nightly scheduled runs
- ✅ Manual trigger support
- ✅ Date-specific branch creation (`frontend_sources/firecrawl/<date>`)
- ✅ Automatic pull request creation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### Caching & Performance
- ✅ Python dependency caching in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Efficient git operations
- ✅ Optimized for minimal resource usage

### Notifications
- ✅ Slack integration for success/failure alerts
- ✅ Detailed status reporting
- ✅ GitHub Actions status tracking
- ✅ Extraction statistics in notifications

### Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive error detection
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on failures
- ✅ Branch deletion for failed extractions
- ✅ Graceful degradation

## Workflow Process

1. **Trigger**: GitHub Actions runs nightly or manual trigger
2. **Setup**: Install dependencies, authenticate with 1Password
3. **Branch Check**: Verify if extraction already exists for the date
4. **Extraction**: Run FireCrawl API calls with secure credentials
5. **Git Operations**: Create branch, commit results, push to remote
6. **Pull Request**: Create PR with extraction summary
7. **Notification**: Send Slack alert with status and statistics
8. **Cleanup**: Clean up any failed branches or temporary files

## Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets
- `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`: 1Password service account token

### GitHub Variables (Optional)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Slack webhook for notifications

### 1Password Setup
- FireCrawl API key stored as `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`

## Usage

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Validate setup
./scripts/test-firecrawl-setup.sh

# Run extraction manually
./scripts/run-nightly-firecrawl.sh

# Run for specific date
./scripts/run-nightly-firecrawl.sh --date 2024-01-15
```

### GitHub Actions
1. Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Nightly FireCrawl Snapshots" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" for manual testing
4. Optionally specify custom date or force run

## Output Structure

Extractions are saved to `frontend_sources/firecrawl/` with the format:
```
firecrawl_extraction_YYYY-MM-DD.json
```

Each file contains:
- Metadata (timestamp, version)
- Extraction results for each configured target
- Success/failure status
- Error details for failed extractions

## Branch Strategy

Each extraction creates a branch:
```
frontend_sources/firecrawl/YYYY-MM-DD
```

This allows for:
- Version control of extraction history
- Easy rollback to previous extractions
- Pull request review process
- Conflict-free parallel development

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Run `./scripts/test-firecrawl-setup.sh` periodically
- Monitor GitHub Actions for failed runs
- Review Slack notifications for extraction issues

### Customization
- Modify extraction targets in `scripts/extract_with_firecrawl.py`
- Adjust schedule in `.github/workflows/nightly-firecrawl.yml`
- Configure additional notification channels as needed

### Troubleshooting
- Check 1Password CLI authentication
- Verify GitHub secrets and variables configuration
- Review extraction logs in GitHub Actions
- Use manual testing scripts for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Configure 1Password**: Set up service account and store FireCrawl API key
2. **GitHub Setup**: Add required secrets and variables
3. **Test Workflow**: Run manual test to verify configuration
4. **Monitor**: Set up monitoring for nightly runs
5. **Customize**: Modify extraction targets based on requirements

The FireCrawl automation system is now fully implemented and ready for production use.
