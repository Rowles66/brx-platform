2. 1Password CLI (`op`) installed and authenticated
3. PostgreSQL database (optional for now, using static data)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Start development server (with 1Password secrets)
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

The application uses 1Password CLI for secrets management. Update `.env` with your 1Password vault references:

```env
DATABASE_URL="op://vault/database/DATABASE_URL"
NEXTAUTH_URL="op://vault/nextjs/NEXTAUTH_URL"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="op://vault/nextjs/NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
API_SECRET_KEY="op://vault/api/SECRET_KEY"

# FireCrawl Automation
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="op://vault/firecrawl/API_KEY"
OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="op://vault/github-actions/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="op://vault/notifications/SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"  # Optional
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with 1Password secrets
- `npm run build` - Build production app with 1Password secrets
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema to database (with 1Password secrets)
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations (with 1Password secrets)
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio (with 1Password secrets)

## Components

Extracted and converted BRX Performance components:

- **AuthLayout** - Main authentication layout with branded background
- **AuthCard** - Card container for auth forms
- **SignInForm** - Complete sign-in form
- **FormField** - Reusable form input field
- **PasswordField** - Password input with show/hide toggle
- **CheckboxField** - Custom checkbox component
- **AuthButton** - Branded authentication button
- **Logo** - BRX Performance logo component

## Demo Credentials

For testing the sign-in form:
- **Email**: `demo@example.com`
- **Password**: `password`

## tRPC API

Available endpoints:

- `users.getAll` - Get all users (static data)
- `users.getByEmail` - Get user by email
- `users.create` - Create new user
- `example.hello` - Example greeting endpoint

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Implement Frontend Scraping & UI Reconstruction (Phase 2)
2. Set up real database connection
3. Implement proper authentication
4. Content Extraction & Schema Mapping (Phase 3)
5. Real-time Diff Deployment
6. Set up deployment pipeline
7. Add comprehensive testing

## Development

The application uses static data for now to demonstrate the UI and architecture. All components have been converted from Material-UI to Tailwind CSS while maintaining the original BRX Performance design.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the sign-in form in action.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 2: Frontend Scraping & UI Reconstruction

This phase implements an automated system to mirror the production BRX Performance UI by capturing nightly snapshots using FireCrawl, analyzing the DOM structure, and rebuilding the component tree for accurate reproduction in our Next.js application.

Key components and features implemented:

- `FireCrawl` headless browser orchestration for accurate DOM snapshots
- Automated nightly extraction pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Component diffing & version tracking for UI changes
- Pull request generation with visual diffs

#### Nightly FireCrawl Automation

The system is configured to run nightly at 2:00 AM UTC and maintains a 14-day retention policy for UI snapshots.

**Script Paths & Purposes:**

- `scripts/run-nightly-firecrawl.sh` - Main orchestration script that:
  - Executes `op run -- python3 scripts/extract_with_firecrawl.py`
  - Creates date-specific branches (`frontend_sources/firecrawl/<date>`)
  - Pushes new assets to the branch
  - Handles comprehensive error management and cleanup
- `scripts/extract_with_firecrawl.py` - FireCrawl API integration for DOM extraction
- `scripts/test-firecrawl-setup.sh` - Setup validation tool
- `scripts/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/nightly-firecrawl.yml` and includes:

- Scheduled nightly runs at 2:00 AM UTC
- Manual trigger support with custom parameters
- Python dependency caching for performance
- Automatic pull request creation with detailed summaries
- Artifact uploads and cleanup procedures

**Security & Authentication:**

- 1Password CLI integration for secure credential management
- Service account tokens for GitHub Actions
- No hardcoded secrets in any code

**Monitoring & Notifications:**

- Slack integration with detailed status messages
- Extraction statistics in notifications
- GitHub Actions status tracking
- Artifact uploads for extraction results

The system is fully functional and includes testing tools, manual execution capabilities, and comprehensive documentation.
