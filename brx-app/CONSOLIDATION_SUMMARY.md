# Consolidation Summary

## Current Status
We've analyzed the main repositories and started consolidating assets into `brx-app-replica`.

## Repositories Status

### 1. ‚úÖ extracted_frontend_auth
- **Valuable assets moved:**
  - Scraped BRX content ‚Üí `/scraped_reference/auth_extract_scraped_content/`
  - AI workflow docs ‚Üí `/dev_tools/ai_workflow_from_auth_extract/`
- **Can be deleted after:** Confirming no other unique features

### 2. ‚úÖ extracted_frontend  
- **Status:** Can be deleted immediately
- **Reason:** Only contains scraped assets that are duplicates

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è brx-platform

- **Contains:**

### 4. ‚ùì Not yet reviewed

## Review Questions Created

### üìÅ `/review_later/auth_system/REVIEW_QUESTIONS.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Delete `extracted_frontend` (no unique content)
   - Test current app functionality at http://localhost:3000

2. **Requires Your Input:**
   - Review authentication questions
   - Confirm brand colors
   - Decide on nested brx-app-replica handling

3. **Pending Analysis:**
   - brx-backup directory
   - _archive directory
   - _management directory

## Dashboard Redirect Issue
Note: You mentioned the dashboard was redirecting to login. This might be because:
1. Old code from extracted_frontend_auth had auth checks
2. Browser cache from previous sessions
3. Need to restart the dev server

Would you like me to fix the dashboard redirect issue first before continuing with consolidation?
