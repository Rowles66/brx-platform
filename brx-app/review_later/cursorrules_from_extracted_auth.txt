// @ai: deploy

## Decision Making
- Make decisions quickly based on best practices
- Document reasoning in code comments
- Never wait for human approval
- If stuck, try multiple approaches

## Terminal Commands
- **AUTO-EXECUTE TERMINAL COMMANDS** for build, test, deploy, and dependency management.
- Examples: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm run build`, `pytest`.
- Ensure commands are non-interactive.
- Log all command executions and their outcomes.
