## ⚡ Speed Tips

1. **Use Agent Mode** - Always for complex tasks
2. **Paste First** - Include code/errors upfront
3. **Be Specific** - Versions, frameworks, goals
4. **Request Validation** - "Check this for issues"
5. **Ask for Options** - "Show me 3 ways to..."

## 🚫 Limitations
- No file/image attachments
- Best for Vercel ecosystem
- May need guidance outside core stack
