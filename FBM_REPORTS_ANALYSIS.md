## üè¢ **Specific Report: "Itemized Visit Report"**

You mentioned interest in the **itemized visit report**. Here's exactly how our `FbmVisit` table supports it:

### **FbmVisit Table Fields ‚Üí Report Columns**
```sql
-- Our FbmVisit table provides ALL data for itemized visit reports:

SELECT 
  v.id,
  v.recordedAt as "Visit Date",
  v.checkedInAt as "Check-In Time",
  v.checkedOutAt as "Check-Out Time",
  v.actualDuration as "Session Duration",
  s.name as "Service Type",
  l.name as "Location",
  CONCAT(c.firstName, ' ', c.lastName) as "Client Name",
  CONCAT(t.firstName, ' ', t.lastName) as "Trainer Name",
  v.price as "Session Price",
  v.isPaid as "Payment Status",
  v.rating as "Client Rating",
  v.notes as "Session Notes",
  CASE 
    WHEN v.packageVisitId IS NOT NULL THEN 'Package Visit'
    ELSE 'Direct Payment'
  END as "Payment Type"
FROM FbmVisit v
JOIN FbmService s ON v.serviceId = s.id
JOIN FbmLocation l ON v.locationId = l.id  
JOIN User c ON v.clientId = c.id
LEFT JOIN User t ON v.trainerId = t.id
LEFT JOIN FbmPackageVisit pv ON v.packageVisitId = pv.id
ORDER BY v.recordedAt DESC;
```

### **Report Capabilities Our Tables Enable**
