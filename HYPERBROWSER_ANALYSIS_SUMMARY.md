## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### 1. **Immediate Actions** (Today)

```bash
# Test the Rails API directly
curl -X GET https://online.brxperformance.com/api/v2/platforms/current

# Check mobile app API compatibility
curl -X GET https://online.brxperformance.com/api/v4/users/me
```

### 2. **Data Export Strategy** (This Week)

Since it's Rails, not Firebase:

1. Request database export from Exercise.com
2. Use Rails console access (if available)
3. Build API scraper for all endpoints
4. Export Stripe customer data

### 3. **Migration Path** (2 Weeks)

#### Option A: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

- Keep Rails backend running
- Build Next.js frontend that calls Rails APIs
- Add HubSpot integration to Rails
- Gradual migration to Supabase

#### Option B: API Wrapper

- Create compatibility layer in Next.js
- Proxy Rails APIs through your server
- Maintain mobile app compatibility
- Slow migration of features

### 4. **HubSpot Integration** (Week 1)

```typescript
// Quick integration approach
// brx-app/lib/hubspot-sync.ts
export async function syncUserToHubSpot(userId: string) {
  // Fetch from Rails API
  const user = await fetch(`/api/v3/users/${userId}`);

  // Sync to HubSpot
  await hubspot.contacts.create({
    email: user.email,
    properties: {
      fitness_goals: user.goals,
      trainer_id: user.trainer_id,
    },
  });
}
```

### 5. **Critical Decisions Needed**

1. **Mobile Apps**

   - Keep existing apps with Rails backend?
   - Or rebuild with new backend?

2. **Payment Processing**

   - Migrate Stripe subscriptions?
   - Or maintain through Rails?

3. **Data Migration**
   - Full export and reimport?
   - Or gradual API-based sync?

## üí° Recommendation

Start with the **Hybrid Approach**:

1. Keep Rails backend running
2. Build new features in Next.js/Supabase
3. Gradually migrate data and features
4. Maintain mobile app compatibility

This gives you a working platform in 2 weeks while allowing gradual modernization.
