# 🚀 Immediate Actions - Pick Up Where We Left Off

## 📊 Current Situation

- **Discovery**: Your production site uses Rails, NOT Firebase
- **Issue**: Docker credential helper preventing Hyperbrowser usage
- **Goal**: Extract Rails data structure for migration to Supabase
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks to HubSpot integration

## 🔧 Step 1: Fix Docker (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run the fix script
./scripts/fix-docker-credentials.sh

# If that fails, manually fix:
ln -sf /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker-credential-desktop /usr/local/bin/

# Or disable credential store:
echo '{"auths": {}, "credStore": ""}' > ~/.docker/config.json
```

## 🌐 Step 2: Use Hyperbrowser (15 minutes)

Once Docker is fixed, let me use Hyperbrowser to:

1. **Navigate to login page**

   ```
   Navigate to https://online.brxperformance.com/users/sign_in
   Take screenshot
   Extract form fields
   ```

2. **Login and explore** (you provide credentials)

   ```
   Fill login form
   Navigate to dashboard
   Extract API endpoints from Network tab
   ```

3. **Document Rails structure**
   ```
   Visit each major section
   Capture API calls
   Note data models
   ```

## 📝 Step 3: What We Need to Find

### Critical Information:

- [ ] API endpoint patterns (`/api/v3/*` or `/api/v4/*`)
- [ ] Authentication method (session cookies vs tokens)
- [ ] Data models (users, workouts, exercises, progress)
- [ ] Payment integration (Stripe endpoints)
- [ ] File upload patterns (exercise videos/images)

### Pages to Analyze:

1. `/dashboard` - Main user view
2. `/workouts` - Workout management
3. `/exercises` - Exercise library
4. `/clients` or `/users` - User management
5. `/settings` - Configuration options

## 🚨 If Hyperbrowser Still Fails

### Alternative Approach:

```bash
# 1. Manual API discovery
curl -X POST https://online.brxperformance.com/users/sign_in \
  -c cookies.txt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "user[email]=YOUR_EMAIL&user[password]=YOUR_PASSWORD"

# 2. Use session to explore
curl -b cookies.txt https://online.brxperformance.com/api/v3/user

# 3. Document findings
echo "API Endpoints:" > rails-api-docs.md
```

## 💡 Quick Decision Tree

```
Can we fix Docker credentials?
├─ YES → Use Hyperbrowser for deep analysis
│   └─ Extract complete Rails structure
└─ NO → Use curl/manual inspection
    └─ Focus on API endpoints only

Do you have Rails console access?
├─ YES → Direct database export
│   └─ `User.all.to_json` etc.
└─ NO → API-based migration
    └─ Scrape via authenticated requests
```

## 📋 Today's Success Criteria

By end of session, we should have:

1. ✅ Working Hyperbrowser OR alternative method
2. ✅ List of all Rails API endpoints
3. ✅ Understanding of authentication flow
4. ✅ Mapped Rails models to Prisma schema
5. ✅ Clear migration path documented

## 🎯 Why This Matters

- **No Firebase = Simpler Migration**: Direct Rails → Supabase
- **Rails API = Easy Integration**: Can keep backend temporarily
- **HubSpot Ready**: Can add webhooks to Rails immediately
- **Low Risk**: Gradual migration possible

## Next Command to Run:

```bash
# First, try to fix Docker
./scripts/fix-docker-credentials.sh

# Then test if it worked
docker pull hello-world

# If success, we can use Hyperbrowser!
```
