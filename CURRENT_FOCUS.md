# Current Development Focus

**Session Date**: June 19, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 2A Complete - FBM Core Tables Deployed  
**Next Priority**: FBM UI Components & Data Integration

## üéØ **What We Just Accomplished**

### ‚úÖ **Phase 2A: FBM Core Business Tables Complete**
- **6 New Business Tables Deployed**: FbmService, FbmLocation, FbmAppointment, FbmVisit, FbmPackage, PaymentOption
- **Enhanced User Model**: Added FBM relationships for trainers and clients
- **Business Logic Models**: FbmSchedule, FbmServiceLocation, FbmPackageService, FbmPackagePurchase, FbmPackageVisit
- **Complete Type Safety**: All enums and relationships properly defined

### ‚úÖ **tRPC API Layer Ready**
- **4 New Router Modules**: fbmServices, fbmAppointments, fbmLocations, fbmPackages
- **Comprehensive CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete for all business entities
- **Business Logic Methods**: booking, scheduling, package management, payment tracking
- **Type-Safe Client Integration**: Full end-to-end type safety from database to frontend

### ‚úÖ **Production Database Deployed**
- **21 Total Tables**: Increased from 15 to 21 tables (40% increase)
- **Revenue-Critical Models**: All FBM tables for $100K+ coach revenue functionality
- **Real BRX Data Foundation**: 139 measurement types, 166 tags, platform config
- **55% API Coverage**: Significant progress toward full BRX API parity

## üöß **Current Focus: FBM UI Components & Integration**

### **Immediate Goal**: Make FBM Functionality User-Accessible
Now that the core business tables and APIs are deployed, we need:
- Frontend components for service management
- Booking and appointment interfaces
- Package purchase and management UI
- Payment integration with Stripe
- Data import from existing BRX platform

### **Priority 1 Components to Build** (Next 1-2 weeks)
```typescript
ServiceManagement    # Create/edit services and pricing
LocationManagement   # Multi-location business setup
AppointmentBooking   # Client booking interface  
VisitTracking        # Check-in/out and billing
PackageShop          # Package sales interface
PaymentIntegration   # Stripe Connect setup
```

## üõ† **Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1**: UI Component Foundation ‚úÖ Ready
1. ‚úÖ FBM models deployed to production Supabase
2. ‚úÖ tRPC routers created and type-safe
3. ‚úÖ Database relationships validated

### **Step 2**: Frontend Components (Current Priority)
1. Build service management interface (`/dashboard/services`)
2. Create location management page (`/dashboard/locations`)
3. Implement appointment booking flow (`/dashboard/appointments`)

### **Step 3**: Business Logic Integration
1. Package purchase workflow with Stripe
2. Visit check-in/check-out system
3. Revenue tracking and analytics dashboard

### **Step 4**: Production Data Migration
1. Import existing BRX services and locations
2. Transfer appointment history
3. Migrate package and payment data

## üìÅ **Key Files for Next Session**

### **Primary Files**
- `brx-app/prisma/schema.prisma` - Extend with FBM models
- `brx-app/src/server/api/routers/` - Add FBM API endpoints  
- `brx-core/api-docs/swagger_latest.yaml` - Reference for FBM endpoints

### **Context Files**
- `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - Overall project status
- `brx-app/CLAUDE.md` - Technical development context
- `brx-app/SUPABASE_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Migration details

### **Working Scripts**
```bash
npm run db:push            # Deploy schema changes
npm run db:studio          # Browse database
npm run db:import-brx      # Import BRX data
```

## üéØ **Success Metrics for Next Phase**

## üí° **AI Assistant Context**

When continuing work on this project:
1. **Start with** this file + `brx-app/CLAUDE.md` for technical context
2. **Check current schema** in `prisma/schema.prisma` 
3. **Reference API spec** for FBM endpoint details
4. **Follow established patterns** in existing tRPC routers
5. **Update progress** in this file after major milestones
